## **Executive Summary**  
This project involves the development of a modernized 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an AI opponent. The primary objective was to enhance the traditional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe by expanding the board size to 5x5 and introducing a win condition of five consecutive marks. The AI leverages the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to provide a challenging and adaptive opponent. Multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) were implemented to cater to players of varying skill levels. The game also boasts a sleek graphical user interface (GUI) with animations and a dark theme for an engaging user experience.

## **1. Introduction**  

### **Background**  
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game traditionally played on a 3x3 grid. While simple, it serves as an excellent foundation for exploring game theory and AI algorithms. This project extends the game to a 5x5 grid, significantly increasing its complexity and strategic depth. The inclusion of an AI opponent allows for single-player gameplay, making the game more versatile and enjoyable.  

### **Objectives**  
The key objectives of this project were:  
1. **Game Development:** Create a 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface.  
2. **AI Implementation:** Develop an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient decision-making.  
3. **Difficulty Customization:** Introduce multiple difficulty levels to accommodate players of all skill levels.  
4. **User Experience:** Enhance gameplay with modern UI design, animations, and intuitive controls.

## **2. Game Description**  

### **Original Game Rules**  
The traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game involves two players taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.  

### **Innovations and Modifications**  
This project introduces the following innovations:  
- **Expanded Board:** A 5x5 grid replaces the traditional 3x3 grid, requiring players to align five consecutive marks to win.  
- **Advanced AI:** The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make strategic moves.  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose from easy, medium, or hard difficulty levels, each altering the AI's decision-making process.  
- **Modern UI:** The game features a dark-themed interface with smooth animations for a visually appealing experience.

## **3. AI Approach and Methodology**  

### **AI Techniques Used**  
The AI employs the **Minimax algorithm**, a decision-making strategy used in two-player games to minimize potential loss and maximize gain. To optimize performance, **Alpha-Beta pruning** was integrated, reducing the number of nodes evaluated by the algorithm without affecting the final decision.  

### **Algorithm and Heuristic Design**  
The AI evaluates the game board by analyzing windows of five cells. Each potential move is scored based on:  
- Opportunities to create a winning sequence.  
- Threats posed by the opponent that need to be blocked.  

**Difficulty Levels:**  
- **Easy:** The AI frequently makes suboptimal moves, providing a less challenging experience.  
- **Medium:** The AI occasionally makes suboptimal moves, balancing challenge and playability.  
- **Hard:** The AI always selects the best possible move, offering a formidable opponent.  

### **AI Performance Evaluation**  
The AI's performance was rigorously tested across all difficulty levels:  
- **Hard Mode:** The AI consistently makes optimal moves, ensuring a high level of challenge.  
- **Medium Mode:** The AI strikes a balance between challenge and accessibility.  
- **Easy Mode:** The AI's suboptimal moves make it suitable for beginners.  

The Alpha-Beta pruning significantly improved the algorithm's efficiency, enabling quick decision-making even on the larger 5x5 grid.

## **4. Game Mechanics and Rules**  

### **Modified Game Rules**  
- **Board Size:** 5x5 grid.  
- **Win Condition:** Align five consecutive marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  
- **Turn-Based Play:** Players alternate turns until a win or draw is achieved.  

### **Winning Conditions**  
- The first player to align five marks wins.  
- If the board fills without a winner, the game ends in a draw.  

---

## **5. Implementation and Development**  

### **Development Process**  
The game was developed using **Python** and the **tkinter** library for the GUI. The AI logic was implemented from scratch, incorporating Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning. Key development stages included:  
1. **Prototyping:** Initial design of the game mechanics and board.  
2. **AI Integration:** Implementing and refining the Minimax algorithm.  
3. **UI Design:** Creating a modern, user-friendly interface with animations.  
4. **Testing:** Evaluating AI performance and gameplay balance.  

### **Programming Languages and Tools**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** tkinter (GUI), standard Python libraries (for logic and animations).  
- **Tools:** Python IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).  

### **Challenges Encountered**  
1. **Balancing AI Difficulty:** Adjusting the AI's decision-making to ensure fairness across difficulty levels.  
2. **UI Animations:** Implementing smooth animations in tkinter required creative solutions due to its limited native support.  
3. **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring the Minimax algorithm remained efficient on the larger 5x5 grid.
